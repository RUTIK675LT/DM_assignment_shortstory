## Research Paper Deliverables - 

After going through the complexities of this research paper, I was able to gain new insights and learned newer techniques which might become a possibility in near future.
I would like to showcase my gained insgishts through these deliverables. They are less complex and easily understandable to people who are less technical in this field.
